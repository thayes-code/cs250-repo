Module Eight Journal

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

User needs are interpreted by directly speaking to users about what they need via focus group or some other meeting. Another way to understand user needs is by implementing a customer review feature, like what Amazon has done for many years. Creating user stories helps here because they are a way to "translate" user's needs into developer tasks to create features with specific criteria. 

I approach developing programs by first understanding what features are required in order for the program to do what it is supposed to do. Next, I plan out how to implement these features so they funtion correctly within the scope of the program; then, I start writing the code necessary to implement them. In the future, I hope to incorporate more retrospective thinking around my work, especially when working in larger projects.

A good team member is one that respects other team members, respects users, customers, and stakeholders, and respects themselves. A good team member takes action and creates the highest quality work to ensure that the enduser's needs and expectations are met. Good team members do not blame other team members for mistakes or bumps in projects; they work with the rest of the team as a unit to solve problems efficiently and adapt to changes in the project.
